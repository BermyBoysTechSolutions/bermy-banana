New with Gemini 3 Pro Image
Gemini 3 Pro Image (gemini-3-pro-image-preview) is a state-of-the-art image generation and editing model optimized for professional asset production. Designed to tackle the most challenging workflows through advanced reasoning, it excels at complex, multi-turn creation and modification tasks.

High-resolution output: Built-in generation capabilities for 1K, 2K, and 4K visuals.
Advanced text rendering: Capable of generating legible, stylized text for infographics, menus, diagrams, and marketing assets.
Grounding with Google Search: The model can use Google Search as a tool to verify facts and generate imagery based on real-time data (e.g., current weather maps, stock charts, recent events).
Thinking mode: The model utilizes a "thinking" process to reason through complex prompts. It generates interim "thought images" (visible in the backend but not charged) to refine the composition before producing the final high-quality output.
Up to 14 reference images: You can now mix up to 14 reference images to produce the final image.
Use up to 14 reference images
Gemini 3 Pro Preview lets you to mix up to 14 reference images. These 14 images can include the following:

Up to 6 images of objects with high-fidelity to include in the final image
Up to 5 images of humans to maintain character consistency
